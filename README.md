This algorithm solve's a very real problem faced in many parts of the world "Identifing Plant Diseases". In this problem set used to identify diseases in cotton, in this I din't used traditional CNN models, rather this algorithm is based on Transfer-learning technique using the state of the art algorithms like the one used above VGG19. The dataset is taken from kaggle and is already divided into test and training set.
This algorithm is able to churn out 86.21% accuracy in predicted the labelled diseases.
