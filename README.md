This algorithm solves a very real problem faced in many parts of the world "Identifying Plant Diseases". In this problem set used to identify diseases in cotton, I didn't use traditional CNN models, rather this algorithm is based on the Transfer-learning technique using the state of the art algorithms like the one used above VGG19. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and is already divided into test and training sets.
This algorithm is able to churn out 86.21% accuracy in predicting the labeled diseases.
